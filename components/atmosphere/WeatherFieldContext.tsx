 * the two routes drive the SAME atmospheric field from a single data source.
 *
 * This value updates only on a coarse cadence (weather refresh + the ~30s visual
 * tick), NOT every second — the live per-second clock lives in its own
 * {@link WeatherClockContext} so that consumers which only need the slow state
 * (e.g. the SceneStage, which derives the day/night flag) don't re-render every
 * tick. Components that actually display ticking time subscribe to the clock.
