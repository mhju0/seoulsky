/**
 * Seoul-landmark STILL-IMAGE field — manifest schema + pure selection helpers.
 *
 * This is the image-era successor to the video gallery (locationGallery.ts). The
 * scene at /sky no longer plays clips; it composites ONE still "atmospheric color
 * field" plate per landmark × condition × time-anchor, continuously colour-graded
 * by the live sun phase (see buildImageGrade in skyPalette.ts). This module holds
 * only the plain-data shapes and the deterministic, side-effect-free selection
 * logic — no React, no DOM, no I/O — so it is trivially testable and shared by the
 * runtime provider.
 *
 * It deliberately REUSES the video selection contract from {@link locationGallery}
 * (condition mapping, the weather-adjacent broadening family, and the hard
 * dry-sky invariant) so a clear sky never grades into snow/rain — the only thing
 * that changes is the time axis: instead of a binary day|night it has three
 * anchors {@link ImageAnchor} `day | golden | night`, chosen by sun phase. The
 * anchor is the HARD axis (mirroring time-of-day in the gallery): the desired
 * anchor is honoured across every weather tier before we cross to a neighbouring
 * anchor, so a night sky never serves a day plate while any weather-compatible
 * night plate exists.
 *
 * If nothing matches (an empty/absent manifest, or a dry sky with only precip
 * plates) selection returns `null` and the caller falls back to the procedural
 * CSS atmospheric field — never a blank scene.
