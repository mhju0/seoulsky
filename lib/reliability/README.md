# Precipitation source reliability

SeoulSky can learn bounded per-provider precipitation weights from completed Seoul forecasts. The scheduled job is separate from request handling; it never fabricates missing forecasts or observations, and it does not make the core site depend on the learning state.

## Daily pipeline

`npm run reliability:daily` runs the thin `scripts/precip-reliability.ts` adapter over the dependency-injected cycle in `cycle.ts`:

1. Collect tomorrow's daily precipitation forecast from every available provider and append one record per source to `forecast-log.jsonl`.
2. Fetch yesterday's completed KMA ASOS daily precipitation observation for station 108.
3. Join prior forecasts to that independent observation and append informative skill records to `daily-skill.jsonl`.
4. Apply unprocessed daily losses to the bounded multiplicative-weights state in `source-weights.json`.

Missing observation data, missing forecasts, and correct-dry days are skipped where they carry no useful scoring information. A successful independent observation still refreshes the state's health timestamp, so a dry stretch does not make healthy learned weights look stale; a missing observation does not refresh it. Repeated runs are idempotent by date and source.

## Scoring

- Measurable rain is at least `0.1 mm`.
- When a provider lacks a clean precipitation amount, rain/no-rain falls back to probability at the configured threshold.
- A miss is penalized more than a false alarm.
- Correct-dry days do not improve a source's weight.
- Quantitative amount error is scored only when rain occurred and the provider supplied an amount.
- Weights remain normalized and bounded by the floor and cap in `weights.ts`.

All thresholds and loss constants are named and unit-tested in `score.ts` and `weights.ts`.

## Runtime gate

The web runtime reads `source-weights.json` through the narrow HTTP reader in `runtimeWeightsSource.ts`; it never imports the batch filesystem adapter into the Next request bundle. By default the reader uses this repository's raw `reliability-state` URL. `RELIABILITY_WEIGHTS_URL` can point it at another durable JSON endpoint for a different deployment.

Every remote response is schema-validated (timestamp, event count, unique dates, finite non-negative normalized weights). Missing, unavailable, or invalid state never throws into `/api/sky`: the loader retains a cached last-good state when possible, otherwise the gate uses equal weights. The gate behaves as follows:

- Missing, corrupt, stale, or insufficiently trained state uses equal fallback.
- Intermediate training linearly blends equal and learned weights.
- Fully warmed state uses the bounded learned weights.
- Multi-source learned precipitation weighting defaults to on. `MULTI_SOURCE_PRECIP=0` is the emergency opt-out; when off, `/api/sky` retains the Open-Meteo precipitation baseline byte-for-byte.
- When enabled, sources fetch concurrently with a per-source timeout. Only returned values participate, and weights renormalize over the available subset.
- Missing precipitation values are excluded rather than converted to zero. If every optional source fails, the baseline remains unchanged.
- `/api/sky` always exposes a small, non-secret `precipLearning` summary for the advanced diagnostics: gate mode, evidence depth, last observation check, and exact effective versus stored weights. `RELIABILITY_DEBUG=1` additionally exposes the legacy raw `precipWeighting` block; leave it unset in production unless actively investigating the model.

## Storage and automation

Runtime files live under `data/reliability/` and are ignored on `main`:

- `forecast-log.jsonl`
- `daily-skill.jsonl`
- `source-weights.json`

`.github/workflows/precip-reliability.yml` runs daily and can also be dispatched manually. It restores and persists only those state files on the orphan `reliability-state` branch. The workflow serializes runs to avoid competing updates. Before every push, a tested monotonic guard re-reads the remote tip and refuses to lose or replace any forecast/skill row, processed date, event count, or newer weight timestamp. Only an explicit known-good recovery may repair the content of an existing row or replace a reset-only newer timestamp with a checkpoint backed by more events and a superset of processed dates. A rejected push leaves the durable branch unchanged.

For an explicit recovery, dispatch the workflow with `recovery_ref` set to the full 40-character SHA of a known-good commit (including a detached commit no longer reachable from the current tip), or a valid remote ref. Recovery fetches that object directly and unions it with the current branch: known-good values win duplicate row keys, unique newer rows survive, and the checkpoint with the stronger evidence (event count plus processed-date coverage) is retained even when a reset wrote a later timestamp. An invalid/unfetchable ref or genuinely incomparable checkpoint fails closed without entering the persistence step.

For the July 2026 regression, the verified checkpoint is `29eea596fa3f538856733542c20967fdebdc93b7` (117 forecast rows through July 14, 51 skill rows, and 51 learned events updated July 10). Use that full SHA as `recovery_ref`; do not use its abbreviated form because detached short SHAs cannot be fetched reliably.

Scoring requires `KMA_OBSERVATION_API_KEY` for the KMA ASOS daily service. `KMA_SHORT_TERM_API_KEY` is only a fallback and may not have the required subscription. A missing or unauthorized observation key causes a scoring skip, not fabricated ground truth.

Before relying on learned production weights, personally verify the latest scheduled workflow and the state branch in GitHub. Local tests cannot prove that remote scheduling, secrets, or persistence are healthy.
